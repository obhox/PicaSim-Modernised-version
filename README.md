# PicaSim

This contains the complete source, including (custom) dependencies, for PicaSim flight simulator: https://rowlhouse.co.uk/PicaSim/ 

It also contains a few tools and pieces of infrastructure that will be needed to build and deploy to Windows, Android and iOS etc (not all platforms supported yet)

I have tried to make sure that credit/licences etc are indicated correctly - please let me know of any errors so that I can correct them.

### User Data Location

User settings and custom content are stored in platform-specific locations (not in the application directory):

| Platform | Location |
|----------|----------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Rowlhouse\PicaSim\` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/Rowlhouse/PicaSim/` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Rowlhouse/PicaSim/` |

Within this directory:
- `UserSettings/` - User preferences and saved configurations (settings.xml, custom controllers, etc.)
- `UserData/` - User-created content (custom aeroplanes, panoramas, etc.)

## Build System

The project now uses CMake with vcpkg for dependency management.

### Prerequisites (Windows)

- **Visual Studio 2022** (Community edition is free) - provides MSVC compiler and MSBuild
- **CMake 3.20+** - install standalone or use the one bundled with Visual Studio
- **Git** - for cloning the repo and vcpkg bootstrap
- **vcpkg** - dependency manager (see setup below)

#### vcpkg Setup (one-time)

```bash
# Clone vcpkg
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git C:/vcpkg
C:/vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

# Set environment variable (restart terminal after this)
setx VCPKG_ROOT C:/vcpkg
```

### Dependencies (auto-downloaded by vcpkg)

- SDL2
- SDL2_net
- OpenAL-Soft
- GLM
- glad
- imgui

These are defined in `vcpkg.json`. When CMake configures the project, vcpkg automatically downloads, builds, and installs all dependencies into `build/<preset>/vcpkg_installed/`.

### Compiling

The project uses CMake presets for building. Use VS Code's F7 to build, or from the command line:

```bash
# Configure (once per platform)
cmake --preset windows-x64

# Build Debug
cmake --build --preset windows-x64-debug

# Build Release
cmake --build --preset windows-x64-release

# Clean
cmake --build --preset windows-x64-debug --target clean

# Or delete the build directory for a full clean
rm -rf build
```

### Running

The application must be run from the `data/` directory so it can find game assets:

```bash
# From project root
cd data && ../build/windows-x64/Debug/PicaSim.exe
```

### Release Packaging

Build release first, then install:

```bash
cmake --build --preset windows-x64-release
cmake --install build/windows-x64 --config Release
```

This creates a standalone distribution in `dist/PicaSim-X_Y_Z/` (version extracted from VERSIONS.txt).

### Building the Installer (Windows)

To create a Windows installer (.exe), you need Inno Setup:

#### Prerequisites

- **Inno Setup 6** - Download from https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
- Complete the Release Packaging step above first

#### Building

Option 1: Via CMake target (if Inno Setup is in PATH or standard location):
```bash
cmake --build build/windows-x64 --target installer
```

Option 2: Run Inno Setup directly:
```bash
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" /DMyAppVersion=1.0.0 installer\PicaSim.iss
```

#### Output

The installer is created at `dist/PicaSim-X.Y.Z-Setup.exe`. Running it will:
- Install PicaSim to the chosen location (default: `C:\Program Files\PicaSim`)
- Create Start Menu shortcuts
- Optionally create a Desktop shortcut
- Register an uninstaller

**VS Code**: F7 to build. Use F5 to debug - the `.vscode/launch.json` is configured with the correct working directory.

### Directory Structure

│       ├── Debug/
│       │   └── PicaSim.exe

└── source/                   # Source code
```

### Compilation Defines

- `BT_NO_PROFILE` - Disables Bullet physics profiling

### Building (macOS)

```bash
# Install deps via homebrew
brew install cmake ninja

# Install vcpkg via git
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git ~/vcpkg
export VCPKG_ROOT="$HOME/vcpkg/" 

# Configure (pick your arch)
cmake --preset macos-arm64   # or macos-x64 for Intel

# Build
cmake --build --preset macos-arm64-release # or macos-arm64-debug macos-x64-debug macos-x64-release

# Run
cd data && ../build/macos-arm64/Debug/PicaSim

# Install staged release files into dist/ (per arch)
cmake --install build/macos-arm64 --config Release

# Create .app and DMG for the local arch
./macos_create_app_bundle.sh dist/PicaSim-*/ dist
./macos_create_dmg.sh dist/PicaSim.app dist
```

The local `.app` and DMG are single-architecture; the universal (arm64+x86_64) merge is handled by the GitHub Action workflow in [.github/workflows/macos-build.yml](.github/workflows/macos-build.yml).

# Notes on the licence 

PicaSim's licence only covers PicaSim source code and some of the data it uses.

The third party packages and assets will have their own licences which need to be abided by.

These are covered by PicaSim's licence:

Under Source
- Framework: Contains fairly generic code on which PicaSim is built
- Heightfield: Runtime refinement for rendering a heightfield, based on a paper by Lindstrom + Pascucci. It was good in its day, but I would not recommend it now!
- Joystick: Marmalade extension for reading joysticks under Windows
- MapTrace: Stand-alone helper application for creating a heightfield by tracing contours (very old!)
- PicaSim: All the application code
- ProcessUI: Stand-alone helper application for processing the UI bitmaps

Under Data
- Menus and Fonts contain UI resources
- SystemSettings contains the "front end" for data - so typically things that are presented to the user, and perhaps modifyable
- SystemData contains the "back end" for data - typically the low-level representations.
-- All text and XML files here (but not .ac and .png etc) can be used under PicaSim's licence.

The following need to be treated differently:

Under Data
- Images and model files come from various sources (ranging from having been created by me, to provided by others) have been authorised for use with PicaSim
- They can therefore be used in direct derivatives of PicaSim
- You will need to request permissions directly from me/the original author to use them in another project.

These are not covered by PicaSim's licence - they have their own:

Under Source
- Gamepad: Marmalade extension written by Gleb Lebedev for gamepads on Android
- bullet-2.81: Bullet physics library (source is under the zlib licence). THere may be some modifications from the original.
- dpi: Marmalade extension for handling screen resolution/DPI
- tinyxml: Under the zlib licence
